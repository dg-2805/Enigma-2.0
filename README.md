Enigma 2.0

Enigma 2.0 is a revolutionary solution crafted to secure your most sensitive information. By seamlessly automating the process of detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from documents and communications, Enigma 2.0 leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) models to understand context and accurately pinpoint various types of PII. This ensures that your data remains protected, compliant, and secure.

Key Features : -


Automated PII Detection
Enigma 2.0 scans documents and communications, detecting and classifying PII efficiently, reducing human effort and error.

Redaction & Masking
Offering both blacking out sensitive information and blurring confidential data, Enigma 2.0 provides flexibility based on your protection needs.

Cutting-Edge NLP & ML
Employs state-of-the-art NLP models such as spaCy and NLTK to comprehend the context of the text and make intelligent redaction decisions.

Scalability & Flexibility
Built with a vision to expand, the platform will soon offer customizable options for different levels of encryption and redaction based on user preferences.

Compliance with DPDP Act, 2023
Fully adheres to the newly implemented Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 ensuring your documents are always compliant with legal requirements.

How It Works- 

Detect and Detach (D2) Approach
Enigma 2.0 follows our proprietary D2 method, where the system intelligently detects PII and detaches it from the public domain, reducing risks associated with data breaches.

Data Input:

Upload your documents or communications.

PII Detection:

The NLP engine scans for PII using pre-trained models.

Redaction/Masking:

Chosen PII is either blacked out or blurred.

Output:

Secure, redacted versions of your documents are provided.

Future Prospects: - 


We envision expanding Enigma 2.0 to offer clients varied customization options for their data protection strategies. From enhanced encryption techniques to tailored redaction and masking solutions, clients will soon have more control over how their sensitive data is handled.
